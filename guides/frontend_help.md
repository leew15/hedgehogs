Some Prerequisites:
```
pip install djangorestframework
pip install markdown
pip install django-filter
```

In the hedgehogsRestApi directory, then run:
```python manage.py runserver```

From here you should have the server running. In order to now see the website, search the following on a browser:
```localhost:8000```

# ENGINEER LOG. Nov 13-20


This one will be slightly longer to catch up on a few of the past weeks (like when I worked on postgres), since I start this after midterm feedback.


### LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

	- Just joined a new team (From data-pipeline to Front end), meaning I need to pick up new skills. We need to get front-end work done for a working live demo, which means I should hurry.

	- I will also be starting to document my work (Shown here) for RCOS related topics (midterm feedback, thank you Professor), and I will be starting "New Member" guides for future open source contributers.

	- To learn to document was something I also have been starting, since I feel like it will be a helpful to my career alongside github knowledge:
	```https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/```


### SPECIFICS:

	- This week I will be starting on learning Bootstrap and the whole workflow of front-end development. After a meeting with the front-end team, they helped me out with a couple youtube videos and pages (Which I will include later in my member guides).
	- Alongside the challenge, will be to get everything installed:





#### Member Guides:

	- I have completed a quick tutorial on connecting to the PostGreSQL table on Linux terminal and on python scripts (psycopg2), though it seems like someone updated the main readme with something similar. I will keep all my guides in the forked repo for now, and present them to Ranjit.
	- Working on one for PostGreSQL, but I am currently more focused on frontend to get this website done with team.

#### Installation:

	- Steps I took to utilize BootStrap

	pip install djangorestframework

# ENGINEER LOG. Dec 4-11




### LEARNING OBJECTIVES THIS WEEK:

- This week was preparation for the presentation and getting everything sorted. Our frontend team did a fantastic job on the website (as seen in the presentation). Splitting up the presentation among a big group like ours was pretty tough, but we got it done. 

- In this last weekend, I am finishing up some documentations and will look to push some of my local repo commits onto main branch so people can access some of my guides.


### SPECIFICS:

- I feel like I do not know enough to tamper with our pre-existing website and add the OAUTH (the system for connecting authentication system with a sort of "key" that they return for you, indicating your access has been approved) There seems to be not really a simple way to go about this for someone with my experience, and although my plan is to continue this process through, I don't believe I can complete it functionally within the website by the end of the semster. I think if I do RCOS again next semester, I will focus on my strengths more unlike this semester when I had to change twice and relearn both times making it hard to contribute to the project goals.

- Apart from my current struggles, I still do feel like I have improved the skills that I researched, so I will continue to include my resources. I will probably focus my member guides on postgresql stuff rather than basic HTML work I studied since most people probably know HTML better than they do know databases

- From one of my other goals last week, I ended up getting the front end service working on my local machine, and getting to have a local copy really helps in my understanding by messing/tweaking bits of html and seeing what follows.


#### Member Guides:

- One of my earlier commits to repo was my script for pushing parsed finsim data through postgresql, and psycopg2. Since I made the general user guide on those 2 weeks ago, I thought it should follow that I add documentation and details as example to back up the quick guide. A majority of the basic scripts run similarly to this and I believe it should benefit a new user with no postgresql knowledge.

- Another commit I had earlier in the year was a text document displaying the schemas of the tables in postgresql, I think it would be wise to check that as a new user to get a general feel. I do know our current schemas and datasets have been changed a bit, so I will look to update that in the future, now that our backend is mainly complete and won't change around much. I should also note that for future users, that should be updated just for clarity whenever the datapipeline schemas are changed

- I will look to start a quick HTML guide, but like I mentioned, HTML is such a widely used language I think there are much better guides already available online like the ones I've used, so I might end up just posting my resources which helped me.

#### Resources Used/Studied:
	
Basic HTML Tutorial (What I used for a majority of last week):
```https://www.w3schools.com/html/```
It has other tutorials on CSS, JS, SQL etc for anyone wanting to learn those as well. It also has quizzes and examples to help apply what you've learned along the way.

Youtube HTML Tutorial (~1:00):
```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE```
This one is a bit more specific on certain points than others, but still a good video and comes with the code that he works with to follow along. It was pretty surprising how easy HTML is once its just presented in a format like this. For example, unlike in C++ and java where you need to create a whole structure to just create a button (Framing, windows, size, location etc), you can just do <button>XYZ</button> and then fine tune it into place. 

#### Installation:

- Sublime text editor lets you edit HTML, and you can run HTML on browsers, so it should be a friendly installation if any


#### Extras:

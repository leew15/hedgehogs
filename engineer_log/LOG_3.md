# ENGINEER LOG. Dec 4-11


### LEARNING OBJECTIVES THIS WEEK:

- This week was preparation for the presentation and getting everything sorted. Our frontend team did a fantastic job on the website (as seen in the presentation). Splitting up the presentation among a big group like ours was pretty tough, but we got it done. I talked about the datapipeline portion though, since it's where I actually got to have some useful work done in the postgres server and was when I felt like I knew more.

- In this last weekend, I am finishing up some documentations and will look to push some of my local repo commits onto main branch so people can access some of my guides. Filing some details from my logs into guides/potential problem help is also something I will do.

- It has been a great semester, thank you to RCOS team (mentors + professors) for the help on GitHub use, code collaboration, and just RCOS general tips/tricks.


### SPECIFICS:

- Put information logged in LOG1 into frontend help documentation, plus some resources I've used to learn on there. Also put in the project presentation we did this week (sans demo which is already available on git), in order to see progress done in a semester, and gauge potential next steps and possible goals to set for next semester.

- Did some quick check-overs on the final website and it definitely seems very official. Talking to the frontend team, they were more skilled in the technical aspects in the website and so they will be doing the documentation/user help to build on the website (like templates, and examples)

# ENGINEER LOG. Nov 13-20


This one will be slightly longer to catch up on a few of the past weeks (like when I worked on postgres), since I start this after midterm feedback.


### LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

	- Just joined a new team (From data-pipeline to Front end), meaning I need to pick up new skills. We need to get front-end work done for a working live demo, which means I should hurry.

	- I will also be starting to document my work (Shown here) for RCOS related topics (midterm feedback, thank you Professor), and I will be starting "New Member" guides for future open source contributers.

	- To learn to document was something I also have been starting, since I feel like it will be a helpful to my career alongside github knowledge:
	```https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/```


### SPECIFICS:

	- This week I will be starting on learning Bootstrap and the whole workflow of front-end development. After a meeting with the front-end team, they helped me out with a couple youtube videos and pages (Which I will include later in my member guides).

	- Alongside the challenge, will be to get everything installed.


#### Member Guides:

	- I have completed a quick tutorial on connecting to the PostGreSQL table on Linux terminal and on python scripts (psycopg2), though it seems like someone updated the main readme with something similar. I will keep all my guides in the forked repo for now, and present them to Ranjit.

	- Working on one for PostGreSQL, but I am currently more focused on frontend to get this website done with team.

	- I will take certain work from the LOG and translate them to member guides down the road.

#### Resources Used/Studied:
	
	Github Formatting:
	```https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax```

	Django/Rest Framework Installation:
	```https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#installation```

	Youtube Tutorial (~1:30 hours) on Bootstrap:
	```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cKsq14Kfsw```

#### Installation:

	- Steps I took to view our current front-end:
	```
	pip install djangorestframework
	pip install markdown
	pip install django-filter
	```

	In the hedgehogsRestApi directory, then run:
	```python manage.py runserver```

	From here you should have the server running. In order to now see the website, search the following on a browser:
	```localhost:8000```



#### Extras:
	I will be away for thanksgiving break so there will be little work on project. Therefore I cannot create a LOG for Nov 20-27.
